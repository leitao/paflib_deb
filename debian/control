Description: library which exposes Power Facilities to userspace via an API.
 PAFLib is a IBM written library which exposes Power Architecture Facilities to
 userspace via an API. This includes the Data Stream Control Register Facility
 (DSCR) and the Event-Based Branching facility (EBB). Linux kernel 3.9 has
 exposed problem-state DSCR usage for ISA 2.06 (POWER7 – emulated) and ISA 2.07
 (POWER8 – in hardware). Linux 3.10 has exposed the EBB facility.
